Ncpol2sdpa is a tool to convert a polynomial optimization problem of either commutative or noncommutative variables to a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP) problem that can be processed by the `SDPA <http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/>`_ family of solvers, `MOSEK <http://www.mosek.com/>`_, or further processed by `PICOS <http://picos.zib.de/>`_ to solve the problem by `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/>`_ . The optimization problem can be unconstrained or constrained by equalities and inequalities. The optimization problem can be unconstrained or constrained by equalities and inequalities. This relaxation is also known as the NPA hierarchy.

The objective is to be able to solve very large scale optimization problems. Example applications include:

- `Ground-state energy problems <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/090760155>`_: bosonic and `fermionic systems <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/peterwittek/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Comparing_DMRG_ED_and_SDP.ipynb>`_, Pauli spin operators.
- `Maximum quantum violation <http:/dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.010401>`_ of `Bell inequalities <http://peterwittek.com/2014/06/quantum-bound-on-the-chsh-inequality-using-sdp/>`_, also in `multipartite scenarios <http://peterwittek.github.io/multipartite_entanglement/>`_.
- `Nieto-Silleras <http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/16/1/013035>`_ hierarchy for `quantifying randomness <http://peterwittek.com/2014/11/the-nieto-silleras-and-moroder-hierarchies-in-ncpol2sdpa/>`_.
- `Moroder <http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.030501>`_ hierarchy to enable PPT-style and other additional constraints.
- Sums-of-square (SOS) decomposition based on the dual solution.
- If using commutative variables, the hierarchy is identical to `Lasserre's <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/S1052623400366802>`_. In this case, the functionality resembles the MATLAB toolboxes `Gloptipoly <http://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/software/gloptipoly/>`_, and, with the chordal extension, `SparsePOP <http://sparsepop.sourceforge.net/>`_.

The implementation has an intuitive syntax for entering problems and it scales for a larger number of noncommutative variables using a sparse representation of the SDP problem. Further details are found in the following paper:
