Revision History
****************

**Version 1.7 (2015-03-23)**

  - New: the function ``find_rank_loop`` aids the detection of a rank loop.
  - New: the function ``write_to_human_readable`` writes the relaxation in a human-readable format.
  - New: the function ``read_sdpa_out`` is now exposed to the user, primarily to help in detecting rank loops.
  - New: the function ``save_monomial_index`` allows saving the monomial index of a relaxation.
  - New: support for obtaining the SOS decomposition from a dual solution through the function ``sos_decomposition``.
  - New: optional parameter ``psd=[matrix1, matrix2, ..., matrixn]`` can be passed to ``get_relaxation`` and ``process_constraints`` which contain symbolic matrices that should be positive semidefinite.
  - New: solution matrices can be returned by ``solve_sdp`` by passing the optional
    parameter ``solutionmatrix=True``. It does not work for diagonal blocks.
  - New: basic interface for `Faacets <https://github.com/denisrosset/faacets-core>`_ via the function ``get_faacet_relaxation``.
  - New: PPT constraint can be imposed directly in the Moroder hierarchy by passing the extra parameter ``ppt=True`` to the constructor.
  - New: Passing the optional parameter ``extramomentmatrices=...`` to ``get_relaxation`` allows defining new moment matrices either freely or based on the first one. Basic relations of the elements between the moment matrices can be imposed as strings passed through ``inequalites=...``.
  - Changed: Nieto-Silleras hierarchy is no longer supported through an option. Now constraints have to be manually defined.
  - Changed: Monomials are not saved automatically with ``verbose=2``.
  - Fixed: wider range of substitutions supported, including a polynomial on the right-hands side of the substitution.
  - Fixed: constraints for fermionic and bosonic systems and Pauli operators.

**Version 1.6 (2014-12-22)**

  - Syntax for passing parameters changed. Only the level of the relaxation is compulsory for obtaining a relaxation.
  - Extra parameter for bounds on the variables was added. Syntax is identical to the inequalities. The difference is that the inequalities in the bounds will not be relaxed by localizing matrices.
  - Support for chordal graph extension in the commutative case (doi:`10.1137/050623802 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/050623802>`_). Pass ``hierarchy="npa_chordal"`` to the constructor.
  - It is possible to pass variables which will not be relaxed. Pass ``nonrelaxed=[variables]`` to the constructor.
  - It is possible to change the constraints once the moment matrix is generated. Refer to the new function ``process_constraints``.
  - Extra parameter ``nsextraobjvars=[]`` was added for passing additional variables to the Nieto-Silleras hierarchy. This is important because the top-left elements of the blocks of moment matrices in the relaxation are not one: they add up to one. Hence specifying the last element of a measurement becomes possible with this option. The number of elements in this must match the number of behaviours.
  - PICOS conversion routines were separated and reworked to ensure sparsity.
  - Moved documentation to Sphinx.
  - SciPy dependency made optional.

**Version 1.5 (2014-11-27)**

  - Support for Moroder hierarchy (doi:`10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.030501 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.030501>`_).
  - Further symmetries are discovered when all variables are Hermitian.
  - Normalization can be turned off.

**Version 1.4 (2014-11-18)**

  - Pypy support restored with limitations.
  - Direct export to and optimization by MOSEK.
  - Added helper function to add constraints on Pauli operators.
  - Handling of complex coefficients improved.
  - Added PICOS compatibility layer, enabling solving a problem by a larger range of solvers.
  - Bug fixes: Python 3 compatibility restored.

**Version 1.3 (2014-11-03)**

  - Much smaller SDPs are generated when using the helper functions for quantum correlations by not considering the last projector in the measurements and thus removing the sum-to-identity constraint; positive semidefinite condition is not influenced by this.
  - Helper functions for fermionic systems and projective measurements are simplified.
  - Support for the Nieto-Silleras (doi:`10.1088/1367-2630/16/1/013035 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/16/1/013035>`_) hierarchy for level 1+ relaxations.

**Version 1.2.4 (2014-06-13)**

  - Bug fixes: mixed commutative and noncommutative variable monomials are handled correctly in substitutions, constant integer objective functions are accepted.

**Version 1.2.3 (2014-06-04)**

  - CHSH inequality added as an example.
  - Allows supplying extra monomials to a given level of relaxation.
  - Added functions to make it easier to work with Bell inequalities.
  - Bug fixes: constant separation works correctly for integers, max-cut example fixed.

**Version 1.2.2 (2014-05-27)**

  - Much faster SDPA writer for problems with many blocks.
  - Removal of equalities does not happen by default.

**Version 1.2.1 (2014-05-22)**

  - Size of localizing matrices adjusts to individual inequalities.
  - Internal structure for storing monomials reorganized.
  - Checks for maximum order in the constraints added.
  - Fermionic constraints corrected.

**Version 1.2 (2014-05-16)**

  - Fast replace was updated and made default.
  - Numpy and SciPy are now dependencies.
  - Replaced internal data structures by SciPy sparse matrices.
  - Pypy is no longer supported.
  - Equality constraints are removed by a QR decomposition and basis transformation.
  - Functions added to support calling SDPA from Python.
  - Helper functions added to help phrasing physics problems.
  - More commutative examples added for comparison to Gloptipoly.
  - Internal module structure reorganized.

**Version 1.1 (2014-05-12)**

  - Commutative variables also work.
  - Major rework of how the moment matrix is generated.

**Version 1.0 (2014-04-29)**

  - Initial release.
